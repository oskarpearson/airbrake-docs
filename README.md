# Airbrake Documentation

This is a public repository for the [Airbrake docs](https://airbrake.io/docs/).
Contributions welcome! Please make sure to review the [Contributing
guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). The
[circleci-docs](https://github.com/circleci/circleci-docs) project was used as a
as a starting point, Thanks [CircleCi](https://circleci.com)!

The Airbrake Documentation is a static website generated by
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). If you find any errors or would like to request
a change or a new document, please feel free to contribute by following the
instructions below. Or open an
[Issue](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-docs/issues) detailing your
issue/request.

## Setup

#### Prerequisites
- Git - system version should be fine
- Ruby - the version of Ruby currently being used with this project will be
  noted in the Gemfile. If you need to manage multiple Ruby versions, we recommend
  RVM though there are similar solutions you can use.
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - Jekyll version 3.

You're welcome to also use Bundler to install the Gems needed. If you are using
RVM (or similar), just make sure they all play nice together.

#### First Run
To get a local copy of [airbrake.io/docs](https://airbrake.io/docs/) up and running you can run the
following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-docs.git
cd airbrake-docs/jekyll
jekyll serve
```

Jekyll will build the site and start a web server. It can be viewed in your
browser at [http://localhost:4000/docs/](http://localhost:4000/docs/). To stop Jekyll and regain control
of your terminal, just type `CTRL-C`. Jekyll knows when you edit a file and will
generate the new version, the new version will render after a few
moments/refreshes ;).

####  Editing Docs

All of the docs can be found in the `jekyll/_docs` directory. You can make any
changes that you need there, If you add a new doc you may need to re-run `jekyll
serve` to have Jekyll rebuild and serve your new doc.

## Jekyll Commands

`jekyll build` - this tells Jekyll to generate the static files for the site,
and place them in the `jekyll/_site` directory. It does not serve the files.

`jekyll serve` - this first runs `jekyll build`, then starts up an included
mini webserver to serve the files from the `'jekyll_site` directory.

`jekyll serve --detach` - this serves the site as before, but runs in the
background so that you can still use the same terminal window. Jekyll will tell
you which process ID belongs to it before it goes so you can use that to kill
it when you want to stop Jekyll. `kill -9 P_ID`. If you lose the ID, you can
run `pkill -f jekyll` to stop all Jekyll instances.

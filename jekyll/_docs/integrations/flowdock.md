Airbrake now sends exception notifications to [Flowdock](http://www.flowdock.com)

### Configuring Flowdock
You will need to gather your **Flow API token**, choose a **Flowdock name**,
and choose a **Flowdock email** to configure the integration correctly.

1. Your **Flow API token** can be found at
   [flowdock.com/account/tokens](https://www.flowdock.com/account/tokens). Note
   that this is Flow API token, NOT your personal API token.
2. **Flowdock name** is the name you want to be attached to the team inbox Airbrake
   message. Can be anything such as Airbrake Notification or your own name.
3. **Flowdock email** is the email you want to be associated with the team inbox
   Airbrake message. Lots of airbrake users leverage an airbrake@company.com email
   address. This is perfect, otherwise any other email address will do.
4. Configure whether you want notifications to be sent to your team inbox, chat or
   both.

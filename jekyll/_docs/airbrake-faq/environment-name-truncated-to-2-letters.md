Before an error group is selected only the first 2 letters of the environment are displayed

![truncated environment](/docs/assets/img/docs/airbrake/truncated_env.png)

### Use unique leading characters for environment names
We recommend using environment names that start with unique leading characters
so the truncated forms are easily to tell apart.

## expanded environment names
After an error group is selected the full environment name is displayed
